# odb-mwe

A minimal working example of an OrientDB bug. This bug seems to be present in the memory and plocal storage, but not during remote access to a server. 

Two vertices are created that refer to each other. They are subsequently queried; in the case of the remote server, the link fields are valid and the mutual references are in place. In the case of memory and plocal embedded DBs, this is not the case: one field is valid while the other isn't. 

## Download and test
